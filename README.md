# DS4002 Project 2

The goal of our project is to predict the amount of civil aviation accidents in 2026 as well as investigate variables potentially correlated with civil aviation accidents. Our dataset includes civil aviation accident data from 2015-2025 from the National Transportation Security Board. After cleaning our dataset, we built our ARIMA model to forecast future civil aviation accidents and ran a regression analysis to determine if any variables were correlated with civil aviation accidents. Finally, we evaluated our ARIMA model based on its RMSE value (target value between 0.2-0.5). We evaluated the regression based on its p-value and MAE value. 

## Software/Platform
